# Advanced-Calculator-C
Advanced User's Calculator written in plain C using cpp compiler.

## Instructions
1. Compile the program with cpp compiler (.gcc). First compile might take a while.
2. Run the program with input parameters.
3. .\program.exe name(string) number(1) *EXAMPLE: .\program.exe  alex 5**
    - **number should be chosen from the list below.*
3. Folow the instruction in the console.
    - Press 'q' anytime to quit the program.

## Features
List of avaiable operations you can perform are:
1. Simple calculation ( +, -, /, *, % ) *Working*
2. Basic functions ( exp^, log, ln, sqrt, n! ) *sqrt and n! not completed yet*
3. Trigometry functions( sin, cos, tan, cot ) *not done yet*
4. Binary conversion (BIN, HEX, DEC, OCT) *Working*
5. Custom functions ( gcd, lcm, matrix ) *matrix multiplication has to be fixed*
6. Complex arithmetics ( a+bi,a-bi,a*bi,a/bi ) *Working*
## Roadmap
- [ ] Remove unnecessary comments, headers etc.
- [x] Fix Assets and Headers layout 
- [ ] Complete Basic functions calculation (ln, sqrt, n!)
- [ ] Fix matrix multiplication
- [ ] Start working on Trigometry functions
